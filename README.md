# monokai-saz README

This theme initially started out as a Monokai edit that was meant to be dimmer, but now it's just its own theme that strives to have detailed semantic token highlighting. It's colorful but a bit toned down. 

Note that I have no knowledge of color theory -- I'm just making something that I think looks nice. If you have any color suggestions, give them!
